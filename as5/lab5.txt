	 //Make fails because the function, futimens, is listed in two different files with different parameters. 
	 This is illegal and confuses the make, causing it to fail. The function headings are listed below.

Debugging
		//I created a new copy of coreutils-with-bug, using the same steps as before.
   	cd ..
     	cp -r as5/coreutils-with-bug/ as5/coreutils-with-bugfixed/
   	cd as5/coreutils-with-bugfixed
		//I entered the tmp directory and ran gdb from there.
	gdb ~/cs35l/as5/coreutils-with-bugfixed/src/ls
	info functions
	b qsort
	     //I used the hint to enter the sort_files function.
	b sort_files
	r -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
	  //I began stepping through sort_files. Looking for function that had something do with the keyword "time", I came across the following line: 
	func = sort_reverse ? rev_cmp_mtime : compare_mtime;
	     //I decided to create a breakpoint at compare_mtime.
	b compare_mtime
		//I continued stepping through sort_files and qsort until I entered this function. In this function, I noticed the following code:
	
	--output-------------
timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:48
46	timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
47	{
48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
49	    return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
50	    }
	--output ends-------------
	
		//I continued stepping through until I was on line 48. I then created a watchpoint for diff.
	watch diff
	
	--output-------------
	Watchpoint 3: diff

	Old value = 1477955025
	New value = 5
	--output ends----------------
	
		//This output looks fine, but I then do another iteration. Since I leave the loop, my watchpoint gets deleted and I have to create the watchpoint again when I step to the line.
	watch diff
	
	--output------------

		//This is the interesting information. It appears that bit-wise subtraction may have resulted in integer overflow. 
		//This may be the reason the date moved to the "future". I then type "c" to continue several times to get the original incorrect output (wwi-armstice listed at the top).

		//After exiting gdb, I decide to enter the file that has the weird output, lib/timespec.h. I make changes to the file such that the ints can hold larger numbers, long long ints.
	cd lib
		//I make a copy of timespec.h to remember my changes
	cp timespec.h timespecold.h
	emacs timespec.h
		//make changes
	./configure
	make
		// I test this change by running the ls command in the tmp directory again.
